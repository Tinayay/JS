We have 3 sprint:
Week 11 by Tues
	Introduction (Me)
	Setup (Skeleton, github)
	Random graph (Jonathan)
	2 real map (Jon)
Week 12 by Tues
	Prove that nearest neighbour heuristics is O(log n) (me)
	2-approximate algorithm
	Nearest neighbour heuristics
	Another heuristics of choice
		Suggestions:
			2-opt
			Closest neighbour (walk)
			Lin-Kernighan
Week 13 by Tues
	Optional Stuff

Product:

Programs:

1) Random graph generator
2) 2 real map
3) Non-uniform graph (optional)
4) Prove that nearest neighbour heuristics is O(log n)
5) 2-approximate algorithm
6) Nearest neighbour heuristics
7) Another heuristics of choice
	Suggestions:
		2-opt
		Closest neighbour (walk)
		Lin-Kernighan
8) 1.5-approximate algorithm (optional)
9) Stability of solution (optional)

Report:

1) Introduction
2) Algorithms and theory
3) Implementation and experiments
4) Conclusion

Things to discuss:

1) Data structures (so that we can split work effectively) Adjacency list 
2) Setup (skeleton, revision control) - gitHub
3) Split work
4) Report writing
